## This project has two part:

### 1. compressing file using huffman-coding

huffman-coding algorithm is an efficient way for file Compression and Decompression. This program exactly follows huffman algorithm. It reads frequent characters from input file and replaces them with shorter binary codeword. The original file can be produced again without losing any bit.

### 2. image steganography

image steganography is the process of hiding information which can be text, image or video inside a cover image. The secret information is hidden in a way that it not visible to the human eyes. to know how this algorithm works, you can read the [article](https://github.com/Reza-81/algorithm_design_project/blob/main/%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%20%D8%A7%D9%84%DA%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%AA%D9%85.pdf) above.
